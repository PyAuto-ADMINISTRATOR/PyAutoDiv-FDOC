## 1. What is PAD-FDOC?
PyAutoDiv-FDOC, short for *PythonAutomaticDivision Formatted Documentation*, is the documentation format that all projects related to PythonAutomaticDivision use. To see it, check out `src`.

---

## 2. Why does it look like a DSL?
PyAutoDiv-FDOC is designed to be both human-readable and machine-parsable. Though, a parser for it hasn't been made yet. One in Python is planned, however.

---

## 3. Why does it exist?
For a more "C-native" way to look at documentation or configs (though that's not it's intended purpose). Also, parsing it would be relatively simple.

---

## 4. Can I use it?
Of course! The formatting is specified in `src`, and all of the types you can use. Though, it is unrecommended to use types that aren't specified in the files. The (soon-to-be) parser wont know how to interpret it.
